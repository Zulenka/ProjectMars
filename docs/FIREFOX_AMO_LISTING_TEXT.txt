Summary
Torn.com faction war tracker overlay with live enemy status, hospital timers, sorting, and quick attack links.

Description
MARS War Tracker adds a tactical overlay panel to Torn.com for faction wars.

It helps you monitor enemy targets without leaving the page by showing:
- current status (Okay, Hospital, Traveling, Abroad, etc.)
- live hospital countdown timers
- sortable/filterable target lists
- quick attack links
- popup quick-view summary
- configurable panel and polling settings

The add-on uses your Torn API key to read war-related target information and stores settings/data locally in extension storage. It does not send data to third-party servers.

Recommended Torn API access level: Limited (or Full).
