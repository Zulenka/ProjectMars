MARS War Tracker - Torn API Key Privacy Policy & API Key Use Disclosure

Last updated: 2026-02-24

Purpose
This document explains how MARS War Tracker uses your Torn API key, what data is accessed, how it is stored, and how it is shared.

Important: MARS War Tracker only requires a Torn API key. It does not require your Torn password and will never ask for it.

Torn API Key Use Summary (ToS-style disclosure)

Data Storage:
- Only locally (browser extension storage on your device)

Data Sharing:
- Nobody (no third-party server operated by MARS receives your key or your Torn API response data)

Purpose of Use:
- Public community tool / gameplay utility
- Faction war target tracking overlay on Torn.com
- Display live target status, hospital timers, sorting, and quick attack links

Key Storage & Sharing:
- Stored locally / Not shared
- The key is stored in extension local storage (lightly obfuscated, not true encryption)
- The key is not transmitted to any server controlled by the extension author
- The key is used only to make requests to Torn's API

Key Access Level:
- Recommended: Limited Access (or Full Access)
- MARS validates capability checks for the selections it needs (for example, user/faction war-related data)

What Data MARS Uses

MARS may request and locally cache data needed to provide war tracking features, including:
- your own user basic/profile data (for faction and war detection)
- faction basic data (own faction and enemy faction roster detection)
- enemy user profile data (status, hospital timer, travel state, last action, life values)
- extension settings and panel state (sort mode, position, polling settings)

Where Data Is Stored

- Browser extension local storage only (for example, `chrome.storage.local` / equivalent WebExtension storage)
- No external database or cloud storage is used by MARS

What MARS Does NOT Collect

- Torn password
- Email/password credentials
- Payment information
- Analytics/telemetry to third-party services (none implemented)

Where Data Is Sent

- Torn API endpoints (`https://api.torn.com/`) for game data requests
- Torn website (`https://www.torn.com/`) when you click attack links or open Torn pages

No key or API data is intentionally sent to non-Torn third-party services by this extension.

Key Security and User Responsibility

- Your Torn API key should be treated as sensitive.
- Use a separate Torn API key for this extension if possible.
- If you suspect misuse, revoke or rotate your key from Torn preferences immediately.
- Torn provides API key usage logs (the `key -> log` selection) to help monitor key usage.

Data Retention

- Local cached war and target data remains in extension storage until:
  - it is overwritten by newer API responses, or
  - you use the extension's clear/reset options, or
  - you uninstall the extension / clear extension storage

User Controls

MARS provides controls to:
- clear cached war data
- clear all extension data (including the stored API key and settings)
- export/import settings JSON

Minimum Necessary Use

MARS is designed to request only the data needed for its current features and to poll within Torn API request limits where possible.

Policy Changes

This policy may be updated when MARS features change (for example, if new Torn API selections are added).
If the extension starts storing or sharing data beyond local-only use, this policy must be updated before release.

Contact / Support

If you need to report a privacy or API-key handling issue for MARS War Tracker, use the project support channel/repository where the extension was provided.
